- "Free Kundali, daily horoscope & AI astrology in English & Hindi."

**What it is:**  
A free Vedic astrology platform (web + Android app) that combines traditional Jyotish with Google Gemini AI. Users get birth chart (Janam Kundali), daily horoscope, Guna Milan (Ashtakoot match-making), Panchang, Muhurat, compatibility checker, Tarot, numerology, dream interpretation, mantra, gemstones, Vastu, and an AI assistant ("Ask Rishi") to ask questions about their chart—all in English and Hindi. There is also a Learning Center (Kundali basics, planets, houses, nakshatras, palmistry, numerology), Cosmic Health (Vedic wellness), transits (Gochara), and an option to book consultations. Some features are free daily; premium and optional ads unlock more.

**Target audience:**  
- People interested in Vedic astrology, Kundali, and marriage match-making (Guna Milan).

- Those curious about Tarot, numerology, dreams, and remedies (mantra, gemstones, Vastu).

- **Free core features:** Birth chart, Guna Milan, daily horoscope, Panchang, Muhurat, compatibility—no sign-up for basic use.  
- **AI that explains your chart:** "Ask Rishi" lets users ask questions about their Kundali and compatibility in plain language.  
- **Bilingual:** Full experience in English and Hindi (and store presence in multiple Indian languages).  
- **Privacy-friendly:** Birth chart calculations and related logic can run on-device; position as "no data collection" where accurate.

- **Modern and easy:** Clean UI, no need to visit multiple sites or astrologers for basics.  
- **Available everywhere:** Web (cosmicjyoti.com) and Android (Play Store).

**Tone and style:**  
Warm, trustworthy, and slightly mystical without being vague. Use terms like "cosmic blueprint," "planetary wisdom," "auspicious timing," "Vedic," "Kundali," "Guna Milan," "Panchang," "Muhurat." Avoid sounding scammy or over-promising. Emphasize clarity and convenience.
