Version 1.2.0 – What's new

• Scrolling on Android – Fixed scrolling on some Android devices (including Android 15). The app content now scrolls reliably with one finger.
• Back button behaviour – Hardware back button now takes you to the previous screen inside the app (same as "Back to Sanctuary") and no longer exits the app when you're on the home screen.
• Chart display – Removed the zoom overlay on Kundali and Transits charts. Charts are shown clearly on screen without opening a separate zoom view.
• Location entry – You can type any city and country worldwide. "Pick from list or type any city, country" is shown wherever birth/location is asked. Added "Use as entered" when your place isn't in the list. Works in Kundali, Compatibility, Personal Transits, and Cosmic Health.
• Cosmic Health location – Birth place/city is now a text field with suggestions; you can enter any city and country.
• General improvements – Smoother navigation, clearer location hints, and better behaviour on different Android versions.
